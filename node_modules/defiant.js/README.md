### Installation from __npmjs.com__
Notice that installation requires "defiant.js" and not "defiant". This is due to the account of "kstngroup" has published it on __npmjs.com__. Making your project dependant to "defiant" might result in security issues in the future since I do not control the namespace of "defiant".
* Correct way to install
```js
npm install defiant.js
```

* <ins>__Wrong__</ins> way to install
```js
npm install defiant
```
